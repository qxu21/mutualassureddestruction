Things that have to be done, but can be delayed until after alpha launch:
-blog?
-fix the redirects on /newgame
-paginate spectate/joingames pages
-newgame functionality for everyone-implement limit to halt spam and dead games
-game limit per user
-captcha and/or email verification for registration


Potential Future Things:
-make CSS not bad?
-allow themes
-maybe some ajax
-publicly accessible archive - this entails oldgame and oldaction tables, most likely
-possible premium features
-better aesthetic :P

Ideas:
-oracle mode: introduce chance into the game
	-missiles only have a certain chance of hitting
	-targets only have a certain chance of taking
	-you are only allowed to attack one random target each turn
		-either everybody can only be hit by one person, or totally random
-skynet mode: add an ai
	-ai might shoot randomly
	-like actual algorithm or something - like city-states in civ v?
	-ai takes over players somehow? resistance? what is condition for takeover?
-doom/chaos mode:
	-a player is voted out every xth round
	-a player is randomly eliminated every xth round
	-super chaos: the voting/elimination is not regular - it happens at random intervals
-for oracle/doom, some players may be able to predict the randomness
